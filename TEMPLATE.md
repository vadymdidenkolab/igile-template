# The igile vault template

This repository is what a new igile project starts as. `igile init` clones it, drops its
history, stamps in the project's key and name, and makes the new repository's first commit.

It is a repository rather than something inside the `igile` binary so that it can be changed
without releasing a new binary — the scaffold is exactly the part a team wants to make its own:
its own `AGENTS.md`, its own conventions, its own CI.

```bash
igile init --key ACME --name "Acme Platform"        # uses this template
igile init --key ACME --template git@example.com:us/our-template.git
```

## What is in it

| Path | What a new project gets |
|---|---|
| `igile.yaml` | The vocabulary: statuses, types with levels, priorities. `init` replaces the project key and name; everything else is yours to set here. |
| `AGENTS.md` | How an agent works in the vault. The normative rules an agent must follow when it edits files directly rather than going through the board. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | A pointer to `AGENTS.md`, so Claude Code reads the same file. |
| `boards/` | Obsidian Bases views. Regenerated from `igile.yaml` by `igile check --fix`, so editing them here is pointless — change the vocabulary instead. |
| `docs/index.md` | The front page of the knowledge base. |
| `templates/` | Templates for a new task and a new page. |
| `.obsidian/` | Enough settings that opening the folder in Obsidian works without configuring anything. |

## Editing it

Anything you add comes along into every new project: a CI workflow, a `CODEOWNERS`, a pull
request template. Two exceptions, which exist so this repository can explain itself without
every project inheriting the explanation:

- **`TEMPLATE.md`** — this file. Removed when a vault is made.
- **`.template/`** — anything about the template itself. Removed when a vault is made.

The one rule: the result has to be a vault. `igile init` validates it after copying, so a
template that has drifted into something igile cannot read fails at `init` with a clear reason
rather than confusing somebody later.

`PROJ` is a placeholder project so that this repository is itself a valid vault you can open in
Obsidian and look at. `init` replaces it with the real key.
